# What next?

The UniLog system has reached the prototype stage and is now ready for initial testing within the university environment.

#### For large-scale deployment, the following improvements are proposed:

#### Hardware Updates:
- Switch to a more affordable and compact ESP32C3 microcontroller or similar.

#### Security and Integration:
- Add one-time tokens for API security.
- Additional encryption of student card UID codes to enhance privacy.
- Update the web platform to automatically detect lecture modes and handle student registration.
- Integration of the web platform with the Pegaz student system to synchronize attendance records.

These improvements will help make UniLog more practical and secure for wider use across the university. The whole system (both device and web platform) can be further refined based on testing results.
